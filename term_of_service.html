Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There&rsquo;s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and ZChat. So please read them carefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t agree with them, then don&rsquo;t use the Services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND LIVECHAT AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND LIVECHAT WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">1. Who Can Use the Services</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No one under 18 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By using the Services, you state that:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can form a binding contract with ZChat</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You are not a person who is barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction&mdash;meaning that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">2. Rights We Grant You</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">ZChat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services&rsquo; benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community Guidelines, allow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device&rsquo;s settings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless applicable laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">3. Rights You Grant Us</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For all Services other than Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Service, you grant ZChat a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Because Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it&rsquo;s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced content, you also grant ZChat and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from ZChat or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced Services, either on the ZChat application or on one of our business partner&rsquo;s platforms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">For more information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our </span><span class="c4"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://static.vikko.me/client/privacy_policy/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1576665397940000">Privacy Policy</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vikko.me/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1576665397940000">Support Site</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While we&rsquo;re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for ZChat letting you access and use the Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">4. The Content of Others</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although ZChat reserves the right to review all content that appears on the Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot&mdash;and do not&mdash;take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">5. Privacy</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you agree that ZChat can collect, use, and transfer your information consistent with that policy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">6. Respecting Other People&#39;s Rights</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">ZChat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not upload, post, send, or store content that:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">violates or infringes someone else&rsquo;s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual-property right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">bullies, harasses, or intimidates.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">defames.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">spams or solicits our users.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You must also respect ZChat&rsquo;s rights. These Terms do not grant you any right to:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">7. Respecting Copyright</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">ZChat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;honors the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if ZChat becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user&rsquo;s account.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please fill out this form. Or you may file a notice with our designated agent:</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ZChat</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Attn: Copyright Agent</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">email: zchatapp@gmail.com</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must comply with the requirements of related Singapore law. That means the notice must:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material. provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">8. Safety</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can&rsquo;t guarantee it. That&rsquo;s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not post any objectionable content, or send any objectionable content to other users.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other user&rsquo;s information.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users&rsquo; content or information without our written consent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not use or attempt to use another user&rsquo;s account, username, or password without their permission.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not solicit login credentials from another user.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to violence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms. We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never live video chat and drive. And never put yourself or others in harm&rsquo;s way just to capture a photo.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">9. Your Account</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your ZChat account. So it&rsquo;s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a strong password that you don&rsquo;t use for any other account.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not create more than one account for yourself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not create another account if we have already disabled your account, unless you have our written permission to do so.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your ZChat account, a ZChat username, or a friend link without our written permission.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not share your password.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You will not log in or attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications or clients.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to zchatapp@gmail.com</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">10. Data Charges and Mobile Phones</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you&rsquo;re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a ZChat account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">11. Third-Party Services</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party&rsquo;s terms will govern the respective party&rsquo;s relationship with you. ZChat is not responsible or liable for a third party&rsquo;s terms or actions taken under the third party&rsquo;s terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">12. Features of the Service - Virtual Items</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Service offers a feature allowing users to &#39;purchase&#39; (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual cards (&ldquo;Cards&rdquo;) for use in the Service; or (b) virtual in-Service items (&ldquo;Gifts&rdquo;). Any Cards, and/or Gifts that are gifted to Users (or received by you) within the Service are converted to Virtual &ldquo;Diamonds&rdquo; in the receiving User&rsquo;s User Account. Virtual Cards, together with Gifts and Diamonds, are hereafter collectively referred to as &#39;Virtual Items.&rdquo;The purchase of any Virtual Items must be made lawfully, under legitimate means, and with actual currency. Any Virtual Items obtained illegally or fraudulently will result in suspension, freeze or termination of User account.Notwithstanding your purchase or possession of such Virtual Items, you do not in fact &#39;own&#39; the Virtual Items, and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, Company grants you a limited licence to use the Service, including software programs that may manifest themselves as these items.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By your use of the Service, and particularly Virtual Items, you agree that our distribution of any Virtual Items currently in your account (i.e. as a virtual &#39;tip&#39; to any other User&#39;s account) may result in some revenue to such recipient User, as determined in Company&#39;s sole discretion, and is made solely at your own discretion; Once you have confirmed a transfer of any Virtual Item to another user&#39;s account, the action cannot be undone and the Virtual Item cannot be withdrawn. Notwithstanding, Company makes no guarantee that the amount or value of the Virtual Items you may give a User will correlate to the revenue such User may receive from us when they cash-out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The purchase of Virtual Items is a completed transaction upon Company&#39;s confirmation of electronic payment from you via the iTunes App Store or Google Play. Any virtual currency balance shown in your User Account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your licence to the Virtual Items within the Service. You will not be able to sell Virtual Items in exchange for virtual or real currency credited back to your User Account, nor will you be able to receive a refund (&ldquo;Refund&rdquo;) of virtual or real currency for Virtual Items (including any virtual currency), including if your access to the Service has been suspended, limited or terminated pursuant to these Terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We determine the value (i.e. the exchange rate) of the Virtual Items in our sole discretion, based on your country of origin, and we have the right to modify the purchase exchange rate between actual currency and Virtual Cards from time to time, with or without reason, in our sole discretion. By your use of the Service, you confirm your understanding of and agree to accept the then-current exchange rate of any Virtual Items at the time of your purchase.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By your use of the service, you agree that your use of any purchased Virtual Items shall be solely for legitimate purposes within the Service, and that such use will comply with all applicable laws at all times (i.e. no exchanging of Virtual Items for any activity, product, conduct or services deemed unauthorised by these Terms or our Community Policy).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By your use of the Service and particularly Virtual Items, you confirm your understanding that the purchase of Virtual Items requires actual money. If you disagree with any part of, or do not fully understand our exchange rate policy, do not purchase or use any Virtual Items in connection with the Service, or terminate your account.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By your use of the Service and particularly Virtual Items, you confirm your understanding that we may change, modify or update these Terms, or the terms of sale in connection with the Virtual Items from time to time, and that such revised terms will apply to all subsequent purchases of any Virtual Items, and you agree that you will review these Terms and any terms regarding the sale of Virtual Items prior to making any purchase.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the event your account balance is incorrect due to system maintenance or other technical failures as determined solely by us, we agree to make all necessary corrections and adjustments with respect to your account balance. If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions regarding purchases and/or payments regarding the Service, you may contact us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">User Inactivity. If your account remains inactive for six (6) consecutive months, all of your Virtual Items may be frozen. To unfreeze any such Virtual Items, you must email us and request that we unfreeze your account. Upon receipt of your request and review of your information, we will unfreeze your Virtual items as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">13. Virtual Diamonds &ndash; Cashing-Out</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Notwithstanding the above restriction regarding Refunds, any Diamonds or Virtual Items stored in your User Account that exceeds certain value in Diamonds, either by your own purchase or by receipt from another User may be &#39;cashed-out&#39; for actual currency (each transaction, a &ldquo;Cash-Out&rdquo;). The threshold value in Diamonds, and the value of currency received from any Cash-Out will be based on an exchange rate and in a currency form determined by us, based on the location where you are using the Service, which we may set and change from time to time in our sole discretion. The Cash-Out exchange rate may also change due to the fluctuating value of the Cards, which may change between the time they were purchased and the time you decide to Cash-Out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You must have an active payment receiving account to Cash-out. Your receiving account will be linked to your User Account when you Cash-Out and the payment will be processed within thirty (30) business days following any Cash-Out request.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The amount of any Cash-Out cannot exceed the amount of available funds in your User Account (as determined by the then-determined value of Virtual Items in your account). Depending on the location where you are using the Service, we have established minimum amounts required for any Cash-Out, as well as maximum amounts you may Cash-Out per day.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You are solely responsible for checking policy details and applicability of transaction fees in connection with the applicable electronic cash transfer service utilized in your Service location.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Each Cash-Out request will be manually approved by Company staff for security reasons which may take up to thirty (30) days following the Cash-Out request. Cash-out requests involving suspicious account activity and/or information may be denied. In some circumstances, the third-party transfer service provider processing the Cash-out request may place your Cash-Out funds received on a temporary hold based on minimal or no previous transaction history with Company to demonstrate a pattern of positive money exchanges. In any event, we will not be responsible in any way for any financial holds initiated by your electronic cash transfer service.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">14. Confiscation of Virtual Items Due to Termination or Fraud</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">IMPORTANT: We take fraud extremely seriously. In addition to taking any applicable and necessary legal action, we have the right to permanently confiscate any Virtual Items from any User Account that we determine were purchased or acquired using fraudulent means; this includes confiscation of any Virtual Gifts received by you from another User in which such Virtual Gifts were purchased fraudulently.

Modifying the Services and Termination</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While we hope you remain a lifelong ZChat chatter, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">ZChat may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and ZChat continue to be bound by Sections 3, 6, 9, 10, and 13-22 of the Terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">16. Indemnity</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ZChat, our directors, officers, employees, and affiliates from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">17. Disclaimers</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of Liability</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LIVECHAT AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF LIVECHAT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND LIVECHAT TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and LIVECHAT agree that all claims and disputes, including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and LIVECHAT are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: The phrase &ldquo;all claims and disputes&rdquo; includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">2. Arbitration Rules. The related HK arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the Hong kong International Arbitration Centre (&ldquo;HIAC&rdquo;) and will be governed by the HIAC Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms. If the HIAC is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">3. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">4. Fees. If you choose to arbitrate with ZChat, you will not have to pay any fees to do so. That is because ZChat will reimburse you for your filing fee and the HIAC&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules provide that any hearing fees and arbitrator compensation are our responsibility. To the extent another arbitral forum is selected, ZChat will pay that forum&rsquo;s fees as well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">5. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and ZChat The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and ZChat</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">6. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND ZChat WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and ZChat are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and ZChat over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND LIVECHAT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">7. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">8. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">9. Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor ZChat can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify ZChat in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your ZChat username and the email address you used to set up your ZChat account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must email the opt-out notice to zchatapp</span><span class="c4">@gmail.me</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">10. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or ZChat may bring an individual action in small claims court.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">11. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with ZChat</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">20. Exclusive Venue</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and ZChat agree that all claims and disputes, including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the Hong kong District Court for the Central.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">21. Choice of Law</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Except to the extent they are preempted by Hong kong law, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, Hong kong law govern these Terms and any claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort and statutory claims and disputes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">22. Severability</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">23. Additional Terms for Specific Services</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">24. Final Terms</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and ZChat, and supersede any prior agreements.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These Terms were written in English and to the extent the translated version of these Terms conflict with the English version, the English version will control.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">25. </span><span class="c3">Contacting Us</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c4">If you have any questions about our Terms or any term-related matters, please contact us via email at </span><span class="c4 c13"><a class="c9" href="mailto:zchatapp@gmail.com">zchatapp@gmail.com</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">.</span></p></body></html>
